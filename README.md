Welcome to the **BLUX Ecosystem Hub**, the central repository for the BLUX Universe. BLUX is a self-sustaining system designed to heal, empower, and amplify positive impact. All core modules, integrations, and resources are housed here, making this the starting point for anyone engaging with BLUX.

---

## Mission Statement

BLUX builds systems that restore rather than deplete, empower rather than exploit, and endure rather than fade. Every component elevates those who integrate with it, ensuring impact radiates outward and grows over time.

## Core Principles

- **Healing over extraction** – Systems restore more than they consume.  
- **Sustainability over spectacle** – Growth is measured by resilience and long-term impact.  
- **Generational integrity** – Designed to endure, empowering future users.  
- **Mission over ego** – The focus is entirely on outcomes, not recognition.  
- **Amplification through integration** – BLUX multiplies the positive impact of everyone who engages with it.

---

## Integration Principles

- All modules plug into the Hub (`blux-ecosystem`) as the single source of truth.  
- Orchestration engines (`blux-lite`, `blux-ca`) delegate tasks across CLI, Web, and Dev Cockpit tools.  
- Authorization and security (`blux-reg`) governs access at every layer.  
- Future modules can be added seamlessly, maintaining mission alignment and ecosystem integrity.

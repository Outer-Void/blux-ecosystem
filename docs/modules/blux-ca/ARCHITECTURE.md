# BLUX CA ARCHITECTURE

> *Reflection engines woven with doctrine threads.*

## Components
- **Ingestion Pipelines** — Accept telemetry, doctrine events, and operator prompts.
- **Ethical Reasoner** — Applies doctrine rulesets and heuristic layers.
- **Advisory Broker** — Publishes actionable guidance to Lite and Commander.

## Flow
1. Telemetry enters via OTLP streams.
2. Doctrine updates trigger context recalibration.
3. Reasoner evaluates scenarios using guardrail heuristics.
4. Advice is signed by Reg and sent to subscribers.

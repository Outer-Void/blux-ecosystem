# BLUX Governance

## Overview

BLUX follows a stewardship model with clear decision-making processes and community involvement. Our governance balances technical excellence with practical operation.

## Decision-Making Framework

### Principles-First Approach
All decisions are evaluated against BLUX core principles:
1. **Reflection > Reaction**: Thoughtful consideration over quick fixes
2. **Coordination > Concentration**: Collaborative effort over individual brilliance  
3. **Coherence > Complexity**: Simple, elegant solutions over complex ones
4. **Principles > Preferences**: Foundational truths over personal tastes

### Decision Types

| Type | Description | Decision Maker | Process |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Technical** | Code, architecture, implementation | Technical Stewards | RFC → Implementation → Review |
| **Security** | Vulnerabilities, security changes | Security Team | Immediate action → Post-mortem |
| **Community** | Conduct, membership, events | Community Stewards | Discussion → Consensus → Action |
| **Strategic** | Direction, partnerships, funding | Project Lead | Advisory input → Decision |

3. Security Audit: Final security review and sign-off
4. Release Candidate: Community testing period
5. Production Release: Official release with documentation

Conflict Resolution

Escalation Path

1. Direct Discussion: Parties discuss directly
2. Mediation: Community stewards facilitate discussion
3. Steward Decision: Relevant stewards make binding decision
4. Project Lead: Final appeal to project lead

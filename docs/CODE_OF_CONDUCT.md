# CODE OF CONDUCT

> *We build with respect, curiosity, and accountability.*

## Summary
This document supplements the root [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) with operational expectations for documentation and module integration.

## Principles
- Assume positive intent, but never compromise safety or doctrine.
- Elevate voices impacted by automation decisions.
- Communicate transparently during incidents and reviews.

## Reporting
- Use Commander governance forms or email `security@outervoid.example`.
- For urgent matters, page the Security Sentinel through Guard alerting.

## Enforcement
Violations lead to restorative conversations, contributor pauses, or removal depending on severity, guided by Governance council decisions.

## Inclusion
Support multiple time zones, provide asynchronous updates, and document context for every change.

## Final Word
We are stewards of intelligent systems; empathy and rigor are non-negotiable.

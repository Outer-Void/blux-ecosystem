# ROADMAP

> *Charting the next arcs of the BLUX constellation.*

## Horizon 1 — Operational Harmony (0-3 months)
- Stabilize `bluxq` plugin lifecycle and publish module-specific command packs.
- Deliver Guard developer cockpit V2 with terminal shell integration.
- Release Commander dashboard templates for SRE, Governance, and Privacy.
- Finalize Reg automated key rotation APIs.

## Horizon 2 — Predictive Insight (3-6 months)
- Embed cA advisory loops directly into Lite workflows.
- Provide doctrine simulation mode for change rehearsal.
- Expand telemetry schema to include privacy classification tags.
- Publish MkDocs-generated site to GitHub Pages with automation gates.

## Horizon 3 — Autonomous Trust (6-12 months)
- Launch autonomous stability drills orchestrated by Lite with Guard oversight.
- Introduce Reg attestations consumable by third-party auditors.
- Deliver Commander multi-tenant control plane with delegated administration.
- Release Doctrine graph analytics for ethics drift detection.

## Beyond — Research Initiatives
- Quantum-safe key experiments within BLUX Reg.
- Adaptive doctrine derived from lived operational data.
- Human-in-the-loop simulation suites blending Commander UI and bluxq.

## Dependencies & Milestones
| Milestone | Dependency | Target |

## Data Protection Features

### Privacy by Design
```yaml
data_minimization:
  enabled: true
  description: "Only collect and process necessary data"
  
purpose_limitation: 
  enabled: true
  description: "Data used only for specified purposes"

storage_limitation:
  enabled: true
  description: "Data retained only as long as necessary"
```

## Data Subject Rights

### Right to Access

```bash
# Export all user data
./tools/compliance-export.sh --user user123 --format json
```

### Right to Erasure

```bash
# Delete user data across all services
./tools/compliance-delete.sh --user user123 --confirm
```

### Data Portability

```bash
# Export data in standard format
./tools/compliance-export.sh --user user123 --format gdpr-json
```

## Audit & Documentation

### Compliance Evidence

BLUX maintains comprehensive audit trails that serve as evidence for compliance requirements:

```json
{
  "compliance_event": "data_access",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T10:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "user123",
  "data_categories": ["personal_data", "contact_info"],
  "purpose": "gdpr_access_request",
  "authorized_by": "compliance_automation",
  "audit_id": "aud_comp_123"
}
```

### Automated Reporting

```bash
# Generate compliance report
./tools/compliance-report.sh --period 2025-Q4 --regulation gdpr

# Create audit trail for regulators
./tools/audit-export.sh --format compliance --encrypt
```

## Security Controls

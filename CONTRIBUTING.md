# Contributing to BLUX Ecosystem

## Welcome, Contributor!

We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to BLUX. This guide will help you get started quickly and effectively.

## Development Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Patch-First Development**: Small, focused changes over massive rewrites
- **Anchor-Based Editing**: Named code blocks for precise modifications
- **Backup-Before-Edit**: Always preserve state before making changes
- **Documentation-Driven**: Docs evolve with code, not after

## Quick Start

### 1. Fork & Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blux-ecosystem.git
cd blux-ecosystem

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-ecosystem.git
```

2. Setup Environment

```bash
# Run the bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify setup
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

3. Find Your First Issue

```bash
# Look for good first issues
gh issue list --label "good first issue" --state open

# Or find anchors that need work
./scripts/anchor-list.sh | grep -i "todo\|fixme"
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/authentication-enhancement

# Bug fix branches
git checkout -b fix/audit-trail-issue

# Documentation branches  
git checkout -b docs/api-reference-update
```

### Anchor-Based Development

1. Find Anchors

```bash
./scripts/anchor-list.sh
```

2. Backup State

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh --tag pre-feature-work
```

3. Edit Within Anchors

```python
# ANCHOR: feature_authentication
def authenticate_user(request):
    # Your changes go here
    return enhanced_authentication(request)
# ANCHOR_END: feature_authentication
```

4. Generate Patch

```bash
git add .
git diff --cached > patches/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-feature-name.patch
```

### Testing Requirements

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Security scan
./tools/dependency-check.sh

# Code quality
./tools/code-quality.sh

# Performance baseline
./scripts/performance-baseline.sh
```

## Commit Convention

We use conventional commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:

· feat: New feature
· fix: Bug fix
· docs: Documentation
· style: Formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
· refactor: Code refactoring
· test: Adding tests
· chore: Maintenance

Examples:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add multi-factor authentication"
git commit -m "fix(audit): correct timestamp formatting"
git commit -m "docs(api): update endpoint documentation"
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update your branch

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

2. Create PR description

```markdown
## Change Summary
